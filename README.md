# SQL Data Analysis with MySQL in Jupyter

This notebook demonstrates SQL query writing and relational data analysis using the `%sql` magic command in Jupyter. The analysis is performed on two datasets:

- `billboard_top_100_year_end`
- `airbnb_apartments` and `airbnb_hosts`

The project includes:
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregation
- Conditional logic (`CASE WHEN`)
- Subqueries and CTEs
- SQL joins across tables

All queries are executed using MySQL syntax inside a Jupyter Notebook environment. The original database credentials have been removed for security, and connection logic is shown for demonstration purposes only.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Topics Covered:
- Top songs and artists over time (Billboard)
- One-hit wonders analysis using CTEs
- Airbnb listing and host demographic analysis
- Cross-table comparisons (e.g. host nationality vs. apartment country)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tools Used:
- MySQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- `%sql` magic (via `ipython-sql`)
- Python (environment setup only)

---

**Note:** This notebook was originally developed as part of a final assignment for a SQL-focused business analytics course. All queries are optimized for readability and insight generation.
